<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's wrong here. The user says there's an error about an unexpected character after a line continuation character on line 4.

First, I'll look at the code provided. Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting from the top:

The first line is "from agents import function_tool". That looks okay.

Next line: "from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n\n". Wait a second, those are all on the same line separated by backslashes? No, actually, looking at the original code, maybe the user pasted it in a way that some lines are run together. Let me check the original code again.

Ah, the original code's import statements are actually written with each import on a new line but with the line continuation character? Wait, maybe there's a continuation character where it shouldn't be.

Wait, the error message says "unexpected character after line continuation character" on line 4. Let me count the lines.

Looking at the code given:

The first line is from agents import function_tool.

Then next lines are:

from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n\n

Wait, actually, the problem is probably that they have \n in their code? Wait, no, that's how the user wrote it when pasting, but maybe in their actual code, they might have used a line continuation character where it's not needed?

Alternatively, maybe the error is from having a backslash at the end of a line when it shouldn't be there.

Wait, in the original code the lines are written with \n, but perhaps the user actually had a backslash at the end of a line, which is a line continuation, but then the next line starts with something that the interpreter doesn't expect. Wait, maybe the user copied the code with \n line breaks, but in the real code, there is an actual line continuation character (like \ at the end of some line that's not needed, causing an issue.

Alternatively, in the code given by the user, the lines like "from email.message import EmailMessage" and then "import asyncio" are on the same line separated by \n, but in reality, those should be separate lines. Maybe the code as written combines multiple import statements on a single line with line continuation errors?

Wait, looking at the original code provided by the user, it's written in a single line when looking at the code block. Wait no, looking at the code provided, let me check again.

Wait no, the user provided the code as a block, but looking at the imports:

Wait, the original code's first lines:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n\n

Wait, that's probably not correct. Wait, maybe there was a line continuation error. Wait, perhaps in their actual code, they have the imports written on a single line with backslashes? For example, maybe the line:

from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio ... but that's invalid. Alternatively, maybe they have a line like:

from email.message import EmailMessage\
import asyncio

Which would be okay, but maybe there's an extra character after the backslash?

Alternatively, looking at line 4. The error is on line 4, which is probably the fourth line of the code.

Let me count the lines as per the user's code:

Line 1: from agents import function_tool

Line 2: from email.message import EmailMessage

Wait, but according to the code given, the code is:

Wait actually, the user's code as given is this:

The original code starts with:

from agents import function_tool

Then the next line is:

from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n\n

Wait, perhaps that was a copy-paste error where those imports are on a single line with \n as separators? Wait, that would be incorrect in Python. The line continuation character is a backslash \, not \n, which is the newline character. Oh, but perhaps the user has an actual line continuation character. Maybe the user had something like:

from email.message import EmailMessage \
import asyncio \

which would be valid, but maybe there's a syntax error in that.

Alternatively, let's think about the actual code they're using. Let's look at line 4. Let me see the user's code again. Let's list all lines properly, assuming that the code is as written.

Wait, let me parse the code as written. Let's see:

The code they provided has:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n\n

Ah! The problem might be that the import statements are all on a single line but with \n between them. Because in Python, the \n is part of a string when inside quotes, but if those are part of the code syntax, that would be invalid. Oh wait, no. The user might have written it with explicit \n, which is not allowed in code. So perhaps in their actual code, the lines were not separated correctly. Wait, but in Python, each import should be on a separate line, or else they need to use commas. Wait, the user's code as presented has all those imports on a single line but with \n separators? But in Python source code, each import must be on its own line unless they're from the same module.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the line breaks. Looking at the line at line 4 where the error occurs. Let me reconstruct the actual lines. Let me think: the first line is "from agents import function_tool".

Second line: "from email.message import EmailMessage".

The third line: "import asyncio".

Fourth line: "import smtplib"?

Wait, if that's the case, then line 4 would be 'import asyncio', which is okay. So the error message mentions line 4. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the user is using line continuation incorrectly. Wait, perhaps in their code one line ends with a backslash and the next line starts with an unexpected character?

Wait, looking at the code the user provided, the problem is in the import statements. Wait perhaps the first import lines have a line continuation like:

from email.message import EmailMessage\
import asyncio

Which works, but perhaps they added an extra character after the backslash?

Alternatively, maybe there's a tab or space after the backslash?

Looking back, maybe the imports were written with a backslash to continue the line, but then a syntax error. Alternatively, maybe in their code, line 4 has an apostrophe or some unexpected character after a backslash.

Alternatively, let me think about line 4. Let me list the first few lines as per the code given:

1. from agents import function_tool
2. from email.message import EmailMessage
3. import asyncio
4. import smtplib
5. from typing import Optional
6. from function_tool import function_tool

If that's the case, then line 4 is just 'import smtplib', which is fine. Hmm, maybe line 4 is the line with the line continuation character. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual code has this part:

The user's code has the first line as "from agents import function_tool", then the next line is "from email.message import EmailMessage", followed by "import asyncio", but written in such a way that a line continuation is used where it shouldn't be.

Alternatively, maybe the line 4 is the line that has a string where a continuation character is present. Wait, the error is "unexpected character after line continuation character", which usually happens when you have a line continuation (like a backslash \) then a newline, but then the next line has an invalid character. 

Wait, for example, if someone writes:

import some\module

Then that's okay if it's split with a \, but if the second line starts with an #, that might lead to an error, but in most cases the backslash is used for line continuation. Alternatively, perhaps line 4 has a backslash at the end of line 3, then the line after starts with an invalid character.

Wait, maybe in the actual code, there's a backslash at the end of a line where it's not supposed to be.

Now, looking at the user's raw code:

Looking at the first parts, perhaps the user might have a problem with the double import of function_tool. Wait, the code has "from agents import function_tool" in the top, and also "from function_tool import function_tool", which seems like it's okay if that's a subpackage, but that may not be the immediate problem.

The error is about a line continuation character. So maybe the actual code has a \ on a line leading to an error.

Alternatively, looking at the very first imports:

The first line is "from agents import function_tool".

The next line is "from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio...", but that might be in the code as written, but actually when I look at the code provided by the user, perhaps the first few lines were mistakenly written on a single line, separated by \n in the code, which would be a syntax error.

Wait a second: The second part of the code starts after the first import with:

from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool

Wait, that's all in a single line, but in the Python code, that's not allowed, because each of those would have to be separate lines or separated by commas if same-imports. Wait, but in the code, they are separated by \n, which in the code would be the same as literally having those\n characters in the code, but in a string, but as code, using \n inline like that would be a syntax error. Wait, maybe the problem is that the code has literal newlines in the imports, but that shouldn't be.

Wait, here's the original code's first lines:

The user's code starts:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n

Wait, but in Python, that's not correct. The \n characters here would be a problem. Oh! Wait, this must be the problem. The user wrote the code such that all the lines after the initial from agents import... are in a single line separated by \n. That can't be valid. Each import must be on its own line. 

Therefore, the error occurs because the code might have an inline \n, which in Python is probably invalid. The line continuation character is a backslash, not \n, but maybe the user actually used \ and then had a space or something. Or perhaps in the code provided, the user's actual code may have combined lines like:

from email.message import EmailMessage\n import asyncio...

Which would cause the \n to be taken as part of the line. Wait, but in the code as written, \n is a newline, but in the actual code, perhaps they had an actual line continuation but added an extra character.

But I'm confused because when the user provided the code, perhaps the actual mistake is that the user is using \ characters or something.

Wait, stepping back, perhaps the user pasted their code with the lines separated by \n in their input, but in reality, the problem in their actual code is something else.

Alternatively, the actual error is that the line continuation is present in the code. Like maybe on line 3 or 4.

Wait, let me count the lines properly. Let me list the code line by line as written, as in actual code:

The first line:

Line 1: from agents import function_tool

Then next:

Line 2: from email.message import EmailMessage

Line3: import asyncio

Line4: import smtplib

That is, the first four lines after the first would be the first four lines are okay. Hmm maybe not. Hmm perhaps the line with the error is line 4, perhaps it's one of these:

Wait perhaps the code actually had a line continuation character (\) at the end of a line before line 4, and the next line starts with an invalid character. For example, maybe line 4 has something like:

import smtplib\ // and then the next line starts with some other character. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the code had a line like:

from email.message import EmailMessage \

Then when they split the line, but then maybe added a quote or something?

Alternatively, another angle: The user's original code may have a line like:

from agents import function_tool \n from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\n...

Where somewhere there's a misplaced backslash, leading to a continuation. Let me re-express the code as per the user's input. Wait maybe the error is from the line with '... def send_gmail_email(' on line some line, but maybe the problem is in the function definition.

Wait, given that the user is getting an error on line 4, perhaps the imports after the first few are leading to that. Let me look at the user-provided code as they wrote it. Let me reconstruct the code as per the user's written code:

Wait, looking at the user's code:

First lines:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n

Wait, but these lines would cause a syntax error since they're on the same line with \n separators, which is not valid in Python. So in that case, the first line after the first import is "from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio..." etc., which is all on one line with \n which might actually be backslashes? or are they literal \n characters?

Wait, no: in the code provided by the user, when writing the code, perhaps they inadvertently pasted with \n in the middle of the code. That can happen if they copied code from somewhere with line endings converted to \n sequences. For example, perhaps the user's code actually has lines joined into a single line without line breaks, and that's causing a syntax error because those lines are joined with \n but in reality, they're not line-continued properly.

Wait, but in actual code, the lines must be separate. For example, this is invalid:

from email.message import EmailMessageimport asynciocompile...

So for example, if they have "from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio" without a comma, then that's a syntax error. So maybe in line 4, there is an error where they put the \n instead of a comma.

Alternatively, perhaps in the user's actual code, the imports are on a single line with incorrect syntax. Alternatively, the error is not in the imports.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the function definition. Wait, let me look at the function definition in the code given by the user:

The function definition:

@function_tool
async def send_gmail_email(
    etc.

No, the definition is okay.

Alternatively, let me look at the send_smtp function inside the async def. Not there.

Alternatively, looking at the docstring: the docstring starts, but maybe there are unescaped quotes?

Alternatively, perhaps the user has a backslash at the end of a line that is not needed, followed by some other character causing the error.

Wait, the error is 'unexpected character after line continuation character'. This error usually occurs when you have a \ (backslash) at the end of a line, which is used for line continuation, but then the next line has an invalid starting character. For example:

line1: something \

then next line starts a new statement without indent or other... like:

print("hi"\
+ "there")

is fine, but if the line after the \ is something else? Maybe in their code, line 3 ends with a \ and the next line starts with something that is invalid.

Wait, considering the error is on line 4, maybe line 3 ends with a backslash, and line 4 has a continuation that's not expecting it. But perhaps in my first analysis, the error comes from the import statements being written on a single line with \n in between, but in the code, they're on separate lines, but maybe a misplaced backslash caused the error?

Alternatively, maybe the first two lines are okay, and the fourth is the culprit. Alternatively, let me try to parse their code as written, perhaps they intended the imports to each be own lines but had a backslash that's not properly escaped.

Alternatively, perhaps the main issue is that there is a backslash before the newline in one of the lines, which I can see in their code.

Wait, let me parse the code as presented. Let's look at the code the user provided:

The code as written is:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n\n

Wait, that can't be correct. Like, after the first line, the second line is starting with 'from email.message import EmailMessage', but followed by \n and the next import. So this code is all in one physical line? Because the \n in the middle would be invalid in Python; the \n would be a newline in the code, but when writing code, each import should be on their own line, not written in a single line with \n. So this likely means the user made a mistake by concatenating imports in a single line separated by \n instead of using separated lines. Therefore, that entire block is actually a single line in their code, which is invalid syntax. That explains why line 4 is an issue.

So the user's code may have a line that looks like this (in their code):

The second import line has a line continuation. For instance, maybe they did:

from email.message import EmailMessage \
import asyncio  --> which would not work unless using commas? Or the backslash.

Wait, the proper way to spread a line is with backslash, so:

from email.message import EmailMessage \
    import asyncio

But that's invalid, because after the backslash, the next line has import asyncio, so the whole line would be part of the same line, and this would be part of the import statement. That is, "from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio" would have an invalid syntax since after the import, you can't have a import again. But maybe in their code, they have a backslash before the second import's lines, leading to an error.

Wait, maybe the actual imports in the user's code are intended to be sequential, each on their own lines, but were written with a space then an 'n'?

Ah, perhaps a typo with \n in the code where a backslash and n are part of a comment or a string. But in the code, the user added:

Wait in their code, after 'from agents import function_tool' the next lines have

from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool...\n

Wait if in their Python file, the code's actual imports are each separated by \ (backslash) to make it a single line? Let's think: maybe instead of using spaces or commas, the user tried to import multiple modules in a single line using a backslash (line-continuation char). But perhaps their code has something like:

from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio\t.... etc, with missing commas? For example, if they did:

from email.message import EmailMessage, import asyncio would throw a syntax error. But perhaps the user has line continuation with backslashes but it's misconfigured.

Alternatively the line in question is the fourth line, which is the first three imports:

Line 1: from agents import function_tool

lines 2 to 5 would be the other lines. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual line where the problem is, line 4 is the line that follows, which is "import smtplib", but the previous line ends with a backslash. But it's hard to see without seeing actual line structure.

Alternatively, the problematic line might be in the function definition, perhaps the line with "def send_gmail_email(" has a backslash, but no.

Wait maybe the user actually wrote the import statements in a way where there is a line continuation but then there's an unexpected character. 

Alternatively, the actual culprit is the function definition. Let me check the function's arguments:

Wait in the function def:

async def send_gmail_email(
    sender_email...
But the line has a comma and a space, so it's properly split.

Alternatively checking the @function_tool decorator: perhaps the decorator is written incorrectly. But that's unlikely to cause that error.

Wait looking again at the user's code's imports. Let me imagine that in their code, they wrote something like:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage\ import asyncio...

where there is a space after the backslash, but that's okay?

Wait if you split imports using a backslash and space:

from email.message import EmailMessage\
    import asyncio

That would be an error, since once you do a line continuation with \, the next line is part of the same logical line, so after the backslash, the next line's line is considered continuation, but the import asyncio would be part of the same statement, making it "from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio", which is invalid.

Ah, this is more likely. So for example, in their code, they might have written:

from email.message import EmailMessage\
import asyncio

Which would become "from email.message import EmailMessageimport asyncio" because the backslash continues the line, so the two are on the same line. That would be an invalid statement because "EmailMessageimport asyncio".

So that is a very common mistake when using line continuation; if the user used a backslash, but then the next line's first non-whitespace is after, making a single line, which is invalid. So the error is in line 4.

Therefore, the main issue here is the import lines: The user wrote multiple imports joined with \n but perhaps using backslashes incorrectly. For example:

Perhaps in their code, they have this:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage \
import asynciol
import smtplib...

If so, then "import asynciol" would be a typo, but that's different from the error message.

Alternatively, here's the problem:

The user may have written something like:

from email.message import EmailMessage\ import asyncio

which would be in a single line, causing import error. So the error would occur at the point where they did:

from email.message import EmailMessage\ <something>

where after the \, the next line has another import instruction, leading to the first line being part of a broken statement.

Alternatively, the first few import lines are okay, but perhaps one of the imports has a continuation that's incorrect.

Wait the user's imports are:

from agents import function_tool

then the next statements would be the imports that come after in a single line? The error is on line 4 (assuming the line counting starts at line 1 for the first import, line2 is the second, etc. Suppose line 4 is "import smtplib" as an example; perhaps on line4 there's a backslash, but the next character causes the error.

Alternatively, perhaps in their code, after the first import line (line1), function tool), line2 is "from email.message...", line3 is an import, then line4 would be something like:

from typing import Optional

but if that line has a space or something after a backslash?

Alternatively, perhaps looking at line4 as the line which, due to previous line continuation, extends into, and then an invalid character.

Alternatively, perhaps the line:

"from agents import function_tool" as line1,

then line 2: "from email.message import EmailMessage",

line3: "import asyncio",

line4: "import smtplib".

Wait those lines would be okay. So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait the user's code also includes imports where "import smtplib\n from... etc, which are all separate lines. Alternatively, the error comes from line 4: perhaps the line has a string or something else with a \n in it.

Looking at the code:

Ah, another area to check: the function's parameter list. Let me check the function definition:

async def send_gmail_email(
    sender_email: str,
    password: str,...

Wait no, the function definition is written properly: the open paren is at the end of a line, leading to line continuation, and the parameters are on next lines, but that is okay because function parameters can continue.

Hmm.

Wait perhaps the problem is with the imports. The second line is:

from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio...

Wait the problem is that when writing code between lines, the user may have used a backslash line continuation but the next line may have an unexpected character. Let me consider this example:

Sup

Sup

Wait perhaps the user's code has a line like this (line 4):

def some_function(\n ...)

with the backslash followed by return then... that's invalid. Alternatively, looking at line 4 possibly being something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo mistake like:

...EmailMessage\"  --> with a slash before a quote or something.

Alternatively, the error occurs because in line 4, there is a line continuation character (like \) and some characters after it in the same physical line? Like the user wrote \ followed by an asterisk or a comma.

Hmm, trying now to think. Since the error is on line 4, I think the first four lines are the problem. Let me count line numbers:

Line 1: from agents import function_tool

Line 2: from email.message import EmailMessage

Line3: import asynciocompile

Wait, perhaps the user's code has a typo: in their actual code, they wrote

import asyncio\nimport... 

Which would be all on the same line with backslashes, causing a syntax error.

Wait, the error message says the error is at line 4, character X. The user mentions the error is at line4. Since the first four lines are the first four lines. The first lines are the imports.

So line 4 would be:

import smtplib

So, how could that be an issue? Well, maybe the line before line 4 ended with a backslash causing the fourth line to be continuation, but the fourth line starts with an 'import' which can't be part of the previous line's context.

Wait, for example:

 Line 2 was: from email.message import EmailMessage \

(line with line continuation here)

line 3: import asyncio

Then the line continuation from line 2 would make line2 and line3 to be in same line:

from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio which is an error. So if the line 2 ends with \, then next line (line3) starts with import asyncio. Then the compiler continues the line2 as from email.message ... import asyncio which is invalid syntax. 

The error occurs because 'import asyncio' would be appended due to the line continuation of that line, leading to "from email.message import EmailMessageimport asyncio", making the two imports together as a single line, but it's invalid. So, in their actual code, they may have used a backslash continuation after the EmailMessage, leading to the error in the next line.

Hence the error is in the importing block where they continue a line incorrectly.

The user may have line2 as:

from email.message import EmailMessage\

then the next line starts with "import asyncio" which would make a syntax error because it's part of the same line.

Alternatively perhaps the line 4 itself has an invalid continuation. 

To fix the problem, I need to correct the import statements to make each be their own lines without any line continuation. Hence the error could be caused by using \n in their code, perhaps when they joined multiple imports in one line. The user might have written multiple imports in one line separated by \n, which in Python is invalid, but in their code, perhaps in reality, they have a line like:

from email.message import EmailMessage \n import asyncio

But that \n would actually be a single line in code (as \n becomes a newline in code?), but actually, in code writing, that's two lines:

Wait, in the code as written in Python, if someone writes:

from email.message import EmailMessage\n...

then the \n would actually be a newline, but that would be in a single line, so the code would be invalid.

Wait no, in Python, the \n is not a literal; it's literally the characters \ and n. Unless the line is in brackets or in a string. Therefore, in the user's code, perhaps they have a backslash that ends a line, and the next line begins with some invalid character.

Wait putting together, the first few lines after the first import are:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage \
# then perhaps in their code they continued the import on the next line with import. So the first import line was a continuation leading to a syntax error.

Wait, to recap:

Sup

If the user has:

import something\
   import anotherModule

Then the two would be as if on the same line: import somethingimport anotherModule, which is an error. Here, maybe line3 in their code has this: 

line2: from email.message import EmailMessage\ import asyncio? Or line4 might be such a case. 

Therefore, the most likely issue is in the import section. The user probably has improper line continuation in the imports, for example, line4 may start after a backslash with something invalid.

To fix the problem by formatting imports correctly, each import must be on separate lines without using continuations. Hence, the first part needs proper formatting of imports.

The user's code's problem is likely that some of the imports are written in continuation lines with backslash but without actually making a new line.

The provided code that the user shows has the second import line (after agents import) followed by other imports all in one line with \n separators but not using proper Python line continuation. 

Therefore, the user may have written the import lines with line continuation, but not properly, so resulting in an unexpected character after continuation. For instance, consider that the user wrote:

from email.message import EmailMessage\
import asyncio

That is, "EmailMessage\" followed by a new line that starts with 'import asyncio' which would be interpreted as a single line:

from email message import EmailMessageimport asyncio

 leading to that being invalid.

Thus, the solution is to split imports into each their own lines without using line continuation between them. So the initial imports should be separate lines.

The original code that the user provided (as per the code they provided) may have the following imports written in this way:

from email.message import EmailMessage and then a backslash and 'import ... 

So, for example:

from email.message import EmailMessage \
import asyncio

That's invalid, because the import asyncio is part of the same logical line, so it would form an import that's not valid syntax. Hence, the error occurs on line4, so when written with the backslash continuation, leading to the second import being in the wrong place.

Therefore, the user needs to separate each import into its own line without using backslash continuations between them, unless they are using the same import statement.

Therefore the correction is simply to split the import statements into their own lines without using any line continuation between them. But looking at the provided code that the user provided:

In the user's provided code, the imports after the first are:

from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n

But in the code, instead of being separate lines, these are all on a single line, so the interpreter is getting all that in one line with \n as a backslash, which is a syntax error. Wait but the user's code may have written all imports in one line with backslashes. For instance.

Wait, perhaps the actual code is like:

from agents import function_tool; from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio import smtplib... 

But in that case, that would give an error.

Alternatively, looking at the imports written by the user's code as pasted here. The presented code is as follows (separated properly now):

Wait, perhaps in the user's code:

The user wrote something like:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage \
import asyncio import smtplib

That would mean on line 2: from email... followed by import asyncio, leading to a syntax error on that line. line4 would then be the next line after the first line.

Wait perhaps the first three lines are okay, but the 4th line has the mistake. Let's try to count line numbers:

Line1: from agents import function_tool

Line2: from email.message import EmailMessage

Line3: import asyncio

Line4: import smtplib

Line5: from typing etc.

Then these are valid, no problem. Thus perhaps the problem lies elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps there are a string that includes a \ followed by other characters. Hmm.

Alternatively, in the function body, perhaps there is a line with a string with \n but no quotes. 

But the error specifically is unexpected character after \, meaning a line continuation (backslash) followed by something not a newline.

Wait, the "unexpected character after line continuation character" usually occurs when there is a backslash before a newline, but the following line's first non-whitespace character is not space/tab, so the line continuation is invalid. But more likely the error arises when a backslash is followed by a non - whitespace character in the same line. For example:

a = 5\
print(a)

This would execute as a single line. But if you have a backslash with a non white-space character after? Wait no, the backslash has to be at the end of a line to indicate continuation. So an example like:

s = "line1\ line2" 

where after the \ there is a space or other characters. However, that's within a string.

Alternatively, if in their code, there was a line like:

import email.message \
    as\n 

then the \n would be part of the line continuation.

Alternatively the error is in their code on line 4:

If looking at line 4: maybe line4 has a quoted string that ends with a slash, such that the next line starts with an invalid character.

Hmm, perhaps the actual mistake is that the fourth line has backslash followed by a non-whitespace character not on a new line.

Alternatively maybe in their imports, they used commas correctly.

Wait maybe in their imports:

from agents import function_tool\nimport asyncio\

Wait, but the original code as provided by the user (the code they pasted) has the imports as:

from agents import function_tool
 from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\n... which might not be how it should be.

Alternatively, the user's code actually has line 4 as:

import smtplib\n

but the \n is part of a string.

Alternatively, the error occurred in the function's parameters.

Looking at the function definition:

async def send_gmail_email(
    ...
The parentheses and commas are correctly used.

Hmm. Alternatively, checking the function's decorator. The first line is @function_tool which is okay.

Wait perhaps the first line is @function_tool, then the function definition... that's okay.

Alternatively, the function's code has a line with unexpected slash and newlines.

Alternatively the error is in the following part:

def send_smtp():
    msg = EmailMessage()
    msg['Subject'] ...

Wait no, not syntax error.

Alternatively, looking towards the code's imports, since the error is on line 4. Let me count the lines:

Let me count the first lines:

1 from agents import function_tool

2 from email.message import EmailMessage\n

... perhaps the line2 ends with a \ followed by a 'n' instead of a \n, but the user actually has a backslash, then 'n', which would be unexpected character after the line continuation character.

So, for example, in their code:

from agents import function_tool

from email.message import EmailMessage\
n 

Wait? Then line3 is that. So the first line ends with a backslash, and the second line has the 'n', so the first line is from email... import EmailMessagena..., which is a name error? Not exactly, but the error here would be after the line continuation's slash followed by an n.

Wait in code:

from email.message import EmailMessage\
n

would have an error at 'n' because after the line continuation, the next line starts with 'n', which is the first character, but that's the first character after the \. The \ line continuation allows to continue to the next line's code, so if the following line starts with 'import' that is okay, but if it starts with an unexpected character like ', ' then its an error.

Alternatively, let's consider the actual erroneous line given their initial code.

The user's code has this line:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage\nimport asyncio\nimport smtplib\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom function_tool import function_tool\n\n

In this context, if that code was written like:

from agents import function_tool
from email.message import EmailMessage import asyncio import smtplib...

which is multiple imports on a single line, missing commas. Hence, causing a syntax error.

Alternatively, perhaps the line4 is the fourth line of code. Let me list them properly:

Line1: from agents import function_tool

Line2: from email.message import EmailMessage

Line3: import asyncio

Line4: import smtplib 

That would be okay. 

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here but the most plausible issue is the import statements are written in a single line with backslash then 'n', which is not allowed. 

Hence, the solution is to split the import statements properly; each import on a new line without any \n between them.

Taking the user's code, I see that the imports after the first line are written all in one line joined by \n, but in actual code that would require each to be separate. Therefore, correcting those by splitting into their own lines.

So the user probably wrote the imports on a single line with \n characters, which are not backslash escapes in code.

The user's original code (original code as presented in their question) has the following:

The
